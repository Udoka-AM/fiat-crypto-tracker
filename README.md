## MagicBlock Ephemeral Rollups Demo ðŸª„

A hands-on demonstration of MagicBlock's ephemeral rollup technology, showcasing real-time, high-frequency interactions that would be impractical on the Solana mainnet. 

### What This Demo Shows
This project demonstrates how ephemeral rollups can transform Solana applications by enabling:

- Instant State Updates: Real-time game state changes without waiting for block confirmations
- Cost-Effective Interactions: Thousands of micro-transactions at near-zero cost
- Seamless Settlement: Automatic state commitment back to Solana mainnet when needed
